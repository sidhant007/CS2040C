  [STLPriorityQueue.cpp](https://sidhant007.github.io/CS2040C/lab04/STLPriorityQueue.cpp) (The STL Priority Queue implementation)

  [UVa 1203.cpp](https://sidhant007.github.io/CS2040C/lab04/UVa1203.cpp) (The solution code for the problem <a href = "https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/12/1203.pdf">Uva 1203</a> discussed in the lab which involves the use of Priority Queue)

## Challenge Questions - 

Q) For PS2 D, try to code your priority queue using pointers instead of using an array based approach.

Q) Given an array of N integers, find the Kth smallest element in time complexity O(N + KlogN) ?

(Note - Sorting will not work) 

(Note - We do not want a randomised solution, so do not think along the lines of n_th element function in the C++ library)
