## Lab 01

Here is a pdf version of the ppt I covered during the lab. And the codes that I (skimmed through) / (demonstrated live).

  [content.pdf](content.pdf) (The pdf version of the ppt shown)

  [vectors.cpp](vectors.cpp) (in-built functions of vectors and algorithms)

  [strings.cpp](strings.cpp) (in-built functions of strings and algorithms)

  [istringstream.cpp](istringstream.cpp) (based on istringstream)

  [register.cpp](register.cpp) (My solution to the REGISTER problem)

Challenge Questions -

Q) Given a string, check if it is a palindrome or NOT without using any kind of loops / goto / recursive statements.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
   Use reverse(s.begin(), s.end()), where s is the string.
</details>

Q) Given a list of names, how would you sort these names in alphabetical order ?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  Push all the names as strings in a vector&lt;string&gt; V, then use sort(V.begin(), V.end())
</details>

Q) Try to do the REGISTER question using the mathematical approach, which we discussed in the lab.
